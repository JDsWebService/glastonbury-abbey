            <h3>Note From The Abbot</h3>
            <p>In order to fight the spread of the COVID-19 virus the Public Mass has closed until further notice. Mass is now streamed <a href="#">Live on Facebook</a>!</p>

            <p>We hope you will understand the measures we are taking in this time of national emergency. By enforcing social distancing measures we can “flatten the curve” and slow down the virus spread.</p>

            <p>Please adhere to all personal safety measures as prescribed by the CDC scientists, and state and local health officials - by doing so you will help not only yourself but others as well, especially the vulnerable.</p>

            <p>Thank you for your patronage and for your understanding. Let us continue to pray for deliverance and wisdom.</p>
