                    Glastonbury Abbey is now offering outdoor Sunday Mass! While we still remain vigilant due to COVID-19 we want to extend to you this unique oppurtunity to still be involved. We still will be following the Mass. State's Health Guidelines, and CDC recommendations during this service.
